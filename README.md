Snake game
* The program uses mostly local variables, so all functions have arguments.
* If some variables are made global, then the number of function arguments can be reduced and the code will be simpler.
* Control of snake - W S A D, Exit - Ecs.
* To win the level you need to collect 5 symbols 'O', the game has 3 levels (these terms are subject to change, look at #define).
* The more collected 'O', the faster the speed of the snake.
